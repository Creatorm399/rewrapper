    <p>Create an <span>HTML parser</span> and associate it with the <var>document</var>. Each <span
    data-x="concept-task">task</span> that the <span>networking task source</span> places on the
    <span>task queue</span> while fetching runs must then fill the parser's <span>input byte
    stream</span> with the fetched bytes and cause the <span>HTML parser</span> to perform the
    appropriate processing of the input stream.</p>
