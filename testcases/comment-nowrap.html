  <!-- Hallowed are the Ori -->

  <p>Origins are the fundamental currency of the web's security model. Two actors in the web
  platform that share an origin are assumed to trust each other and to have the same authority.
  Actors with differing origins are considered potentially hostile versus each other, and are
  isolated from each other to varying degrees.</p>
