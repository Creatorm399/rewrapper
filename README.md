# The Great Rewrapper

This is a web application meant to make it easy to rewrap text to fit line limits. Its primary intended audience is people contributing to the [HTML Standard](https://github.com/whatwg/html), but it is probably useful for other purposes as well.

Patches are definitely welcome. It doesn't always do the right thing currently, which is why I put it on GitHub so that people could improve it.
